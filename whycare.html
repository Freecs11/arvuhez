                            <div key="0">that's a fair question to ask , and it's very essential to understand the mouvements and all the events promoting this idea of taking care of our environment. Now to start, as you know the environment around us is an essential
                                part of our survival. I like to believe that people who do not care about the environment, simply do not understand how important it is to all of us and think that it does not affect them directly in their day to day life
                                and i disagree with that assumption, these are my reasons you should be concerned about the environment.

                                <h2>A Healthy life needs a 'Healthy' Environment :</h2> <br/> many people aren't aware of this , but a lot of diseases are caused by an unclean environment, the more we don't take care of our environment , the more it becomes
                                polluted with contaminants and toxins who have huge impacts on our health, take for exemple air pollution, it can cause respiratory diseases and cancer and those are just the top on the iceberg it causes alot more problems
                                that are even more dangerous, another exemple would be cater pollution, etc.
                                <h2>Global warming:</h2> <br/> yes this one is a little tricky, yes it does not affect you directly, what it will affect if it's left is your children and their lives and their future. <br/>
                                <h2>Importance of Biodiversity:</h2> <br/> Biodiversity refers to the variety of plants, animals, and other living things in our world. it can be negatively influenced by habitat loss and degradation due to human activity,
                                climate change, and pollution, among other things.
                                <br>
                                <h2>Lastly Take care Of Your Home :
                                </h2>this doesn't get as much credit as it deserves but yes earth is your home, so why tarnish it , do you do the same on your house ?
