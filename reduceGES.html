                                while researching on the topic of climatic change, i was met with the term carbon footprint a lot and didn’t really know what it meant , i obviously know it’s a bad term and it’s something we should limit but i never really went out of my way to research
                                about it, so this time around i did research it and i would like to go and share my discoveries with you.

                                <h3>What’s the carbon footprint?</h3>
                                it’s a measurement unit , it allows us to measure greenhouse gas emissions. The latter are gasses such as CO2 or methane which are as you know main culprits responsible for the global warming that our planet is undergoing, the carbon footprint is the
                                amount of these gasses released in the atmosphere because of our actions.

                                <h3>What’s our university objective moving forward regarding reducing the carbon footprint ?
                                </h3>
                                Our university is building a balance sheet that goes over the regulatory requirement . This approach is part of the university’s plan : “Rennes 1 Campus 2030” , which aims to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 through an ambitious renovation plan and the
                                rationalization of uses to to reduce the establishments energy bill.
                                <h3> Simple ways to reduce our carbon footprint:
                                </h3>
                                <h3>Limit your meat consommation</h3>
                                i was surprised by this but yes limiting and taking precaution on what we eat is very important in the fight to limit our carbon footprint. The reason for this is kinda repeating throughout this list, it’s very effective because as of today the meat industrial
                                sector is one the main contributors to greenhouse gas emissions.

                                <h3>Stop using your car</h3>
                                I think this one doesn’t need any briefing as we hear about this everyday on the news, it’s also an action that the government is adamant on making happen as soon as possible especially in the big cities.
                                <h3>Recycle</h3>
                                We produce an astonishing 2.14 Billion tons of waste every year. A large amount of our everyday tools we tend to throw after one use are reusable and/or recyclable.
                                <h3>Your Money</h3>
                                I wrote this title as a joke but it turns out that it’s not so much of a joke, our money (at least majority of us) is stored in banks and well they are very known for funding fossil fuel industry and it’s done using our money so choose well where you
                                spend/store your money.
